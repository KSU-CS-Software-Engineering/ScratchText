# Scratch Text
Scratch Text is a project intended to add a text based aspect to [Scratch 3.0](https://scratch.mit.edu/). This extension will create a smoother transition for younger developers who are used to using Scratch and wish to learn how to program their projects in a text based format.

## How It Works
A new tab is implemented that allows you to view and create blocks in a text format.  You can drag blocks onto the screen from the `Code` tab and then click on the `Text` tab in order to view the text representation of your project.

You can also select the `Text` tab at first and create any blocks by following the [Scratch Text language](https://github.com/KSU-CS-Software-Engineering/scratch-text/blob/dev/Scratch_EBNF.ebnf). At any time you can navigate back to the `Code` section to see the text you created in the form of blocks.
